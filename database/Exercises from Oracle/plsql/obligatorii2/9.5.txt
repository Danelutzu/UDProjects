1.	If you wanted user SUSAN to be able to execute SELECT and all DML statements on your COUNTRIES table, what SQL statement would you execute to give her the required privileges? 
GRANT SELECT ,INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
ON countries TO SUSAN;


2.	User TOM creates a table called TOMTAB, but does not grant you any privileges on it.   
 
A.	If you try to execute the following statement, will it work? 
 
INSERT INTO tom.tomtab (…) VALUES (…); 
 
Nu va merge pentru ca accesul nu este permis, nu avem INSERT privilege.
 
B.	Examine the following code. The INSERT statement has been included in a procedure which you have created. Will it work now? 
 
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE my_ins_proc 
  IS 
BEGIN 
  INSERT INTO tom.tomtab (…) 
    VALUES (…); END; 

Nu va merge, nu avem Execute privilege
C.	TOM now executes the following statement: 
 
GRANT INSERT ON tomtab TO <your user name>; 
 
Will your my_ins_proc procedure work now? Why or why not? 

Va merge pentru ca va avea insert privilege 
D.	TOM now REVOKEs your INSERT privilege on tomtab. TOM then writes the following procedure. Which privilege must TOM grant to you to allow you to execute his tom_ins_proc procedure? With this privilege, will the INSERT work when you invoke TOM’s procedure? 
 
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE tom_ins_proc 
  IS 
BEGIN 
  INSERT into tom.tomtab (…) 
    VALUES (…); 
END; 

Nu va merge, este nevoie de EXECUTE PRIVILEGE.
 
3.	Create a SELECT statement to display all the procedures and functions which you can execute? 
 SELECT * FROM ALL_OBJECTS WHERE OBJECT_TYPE IN ('FUNCTION','PROCEDURE')
4.	In this question, you will need to pair up with one other student. You will then grant access to one of your procedures to the other student, and he or she will do the same to you. Each of you will then execute the other student’s procedure and see the effects on the other student’s table. For the rest of this question, we call one of you Student A and the other Student B.  
 
a.	(Both students): create a table called NEW_DEPT_TAB using the DEPARTMENT table. 
create table new_dept_tab AS (select * from departments);
 
b.	(Both students): create a procedure called ins_new_dept which inserts a record into the new_dept_tab table. 
 
c.	(Both students): grant EXECUTE privilege on your ins_new_emp procedure to the other student.  
 
d.	(Both students): check that you can see the definition of the other student’s procedure.  
 
e.	(Student A): insert an employee record using Student B’s ins_new_emp procedure. 
 
f.	(Student B): insert an employee record using Student A’s ins_new_emp procedure. 
 
g.	(Both students): Query your own new_dept_tab table and check that you can see the new row inserted by the other student.  
 
h.	(Both students): remove the right to execute your procedure from the other student. 
 
i.	(Both students): check that you can no longer see the other student’s ins_new_emp procedure.
