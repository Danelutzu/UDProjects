SELECT  e.name ,p.code
from  D_EVENTS e, D_PACKAGES p
WHERE(e.cost BETWEEN p.low_range AND p.high_range);
2.
SELECT e.last_name, e.salary, j.grade_level
FROM employees e,job_grades j
WHERE e.salary BETWEEN j.lowest_sal AND j.highest_sal;

equijoin is based on a exact match(=) between columns of two tables 
so a nonequijoin is when there is no exact match but there is still a relation 
4.
WHERE a.ranking >=g.lowest_rank and a.ranking<= g.highest_rank   
5.
you use a table alias when you need to work with two or more columns with the same name so you can distinguish them

SELECT *
FROM f_customers c left outer join f_orders o
ON(c.id=o.cust_id)
8.
SELECT  e.last_name, d.department_ID ,d.department_name
FROM employees e , departments d
where e.employee_id=d.department_id(+)
9.
SELECT  e.last_name, d.department_ID ,d.department_name
FROM employees e , departments d
where e.employee_id(+)=d.department_id
10.
a.you can't use (+) in the both directions.That should be equivalent to full outer join but using (+) in a full outer join is not possible
b.you can't use e. or d. if in from clause you gave no aliases to table names

SELECT d_cds.title , d_track_listings.song_id

If I had to think of my dream job ,it would be something based on scuba diving or taking part in some competitions/teams using sports.
Scuba diving is considered a dangerous thing so it is well payed, you can have the chance to see some awesome landscapes and be a part of under water world.
Sports could keep me fit and healthy and you also have the opportunity to see different places on the globe and have a lot of money if you are good enough
