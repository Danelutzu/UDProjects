for example,when i have a flight to a state where the time zone is different from the point i go,and i need to know that state time zone
when it is a common work on a code/site and it saves the date of the last modification and there are working people from different regions,we need to know the date in our local time zone
or there is a football match in another state and it is live presented, i need to convert the our of beginning in that state to the our of beginning in my state
